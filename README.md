# VRTK Examples

## Overview

This repo is a set of examples of some basic workflows using VRTK (Virtual Reality ToolKit) in Unity. It's very much a WIP, so there won't be much here for a bit.

This was done using Unity version 2019.1.10f, and VRTK version 4.0.0 beta ([29d098c](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK/commit/29d098ce511e9c18a189327b74029b193d6011a9)).
